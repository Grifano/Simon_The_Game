## Overview

### How to play?

The screen has four colored buttons, each producing a particular tone when it is pressed or activated by the device. A round in the game consists of the device lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Jquery

### What I learned
- Adding and removing class from element using Jquery methods
- Catching an events
- Playing sound
- Combining the string and variable for using like a input for function
- Using anonymous function

This small piece of code make the game make a sound üòÄ

```JavaScript
// Playing the sound
function playSound(name) {
	// Play the sound for the button colour selected.
	var sound = new Audio("sounds/" + name + ".mp3");
	sound.play();
}
```
OMG! Jquery is amazing ü§©! So easy to animate a button, What else awaits me ahead?
```Jquery
// Animate a flash to the button selected.
$(selectedBtn).fadeOut(100).fadeIn(100);
```
Simple way to add and remove a class from an element after a while
```Jquery
// Animating the clicked button
function animatePress(currentColour) {
	// Use jQuery to add this pressed class to the button that gets clicked inside animatePress().
	currentColour.addClass('pressed');
	// use Google / Stackoverflow to figure out how you can use Javascript to remove the pressed class after a 100 milliseconds.
	setTimeout(function () {
		currentColour.removeClass('pressed');
	}, 100)
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn a JavaScript and Jquery. So many want to learn üòÄ

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow - How to play sound using JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9419263/how-to-play-audio) - This helped me to figure out how to play sound using JavaScript.
